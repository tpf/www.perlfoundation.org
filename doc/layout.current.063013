OVERVIEW

1. A new engine to power the site.
2. A new design for the site.
3. A new hosting location (Dan has already made some very sensible suggestions to this and Casey has the current site stabilised on a server he can control) where it is controlled by the Org.

STAGE 0

1. Assess what we need to port from the old site.
2. Organise a repo. and snapshot the data to it with updates when content changes.
3. Define a feature list for the first stage of the site
3.1 draw up a huge list of features, wishes, requirements
3.2 triage this down to basic needs
3.3 define from triage list what the stage 1 framework will support/perform
3.4 make up a wish list for future stages

STAGE 1

1. Build framework for new site
1.1 Choose projects, libraries and modules
1.2 Assess requirements (hardware and software)
